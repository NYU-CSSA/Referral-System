# NYU CSSA Referral System

## To developers:
Don't be afraid of the complicated directory structures, 
I just learned and applied a PHP framework called [`Symfony`](https://symfony.com) to it.
Also I want to deploy this web app on [`Heroku`](https://heroku.com)

In order to get your hands dirty, you should go through the basic trial of both frameworks:

- For `Symfony`:
    - After reading [this](https://symfony.com/at-a-glance) you should have a simple idea of what does symfony do.
    - Then you should read through [this tutorial](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html) and do it yourself by
     following the instructions, after which you should know how to install and use it to create an amazing website. 
     (Note: you should read all Chapter 1 - Chapter 5 of the [getting started tutorial](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html#gsc.tab=0))
    - Once you finish these simple readings, you will find this repository really really easy to understand.

- For `Heroku`:
    - Heroku is a company that can help us cheaply deploy a web app into the internet.
    Rather than purchasing a Virtual Machine to serve as a real server, we can directly upload our project source code
    and Heroku will run the codes in its "cloud". So we know our code is running in the cloud but we do not know which machine
    is running our code. As a result, we only need to focus on developing the logic and the contents, and all other things
    (such as network, firewall, maintaining the OS and VM) will be handled by Heroku.
    
    - After knowing what Heroku is, you should try [this little tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php)
    to deploy a really simple php project on your free account. Trust me it's not hard and it will be interesting.
    
Have fun with the framework and the tool!
